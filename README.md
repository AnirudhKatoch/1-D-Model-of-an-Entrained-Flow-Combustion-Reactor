Tasks carried out

* Gained expertise in object-oriented programming and mathematical modeling on Python and MATLAB.
* Skillfully extracted and analyzed complex Excel data using Pandas, SciPy and NumPy in Python.
* Designed, automated, and simulated a Python-based mathematical model for an entrained flow combustor.
* Successfully integrated the developed model with REFPROP to enhance fluid behavior modeling and analysis.



Global Parameters

## `GlobalParameters.py` is a Python class designed for entrained flow combustion reactor simulations. It provides essential global parameters, ensuring accuracy and consistency in the simulations. The class follows object-oriented principles, encapsulating properties like `Fuel1`, `Fuel2`, `Geometry`, `Conditions`, and `n0`. Well-documented and error-free, it allows for easy extension and maintenance, serving as a fundamental component of the simulation.
